# React Highcharts Wrapper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beestripes/react-highcharts-wrapper.svg?branch=master&)](https://travis-ci.org/beestripes/react-highcharts-wrapper)

React and Highcharts the right way.


## Problems this library sets out to solve

1. Highcharts does not translate to the ES6+ ecosystem, as the Highcharts constructor is not global. Therefore, you can not apply application wide configuration to Highcharts.

2. Highcharts depends on the DOM existing to render.

3. Rehydrating Highcharts in the React view rerendering paradigm 


## How does the library solve these 

1. HighchartsProvider and withHighcharts

2.3. AbstractWidget component


## Getting started

1. Add the module to your React app:

`npm install react-highcharts-wrapper`


2. Follow the instructions how to use it (coming soon).
