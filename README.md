# React Highcharts Higher Order Component

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beestripes/react-highcharts-wrapper.svg?branch=master&)](https://travis-ci.org/beestripes/react-highcharts-wrapper)

Reactify Highcharts the right way.


## Problems this library sets out to solve

1. Highcharts does not translate to the ES6+ ecosystem, as the Highcharts constructor is not global. Therefore, you can not apply application wide configuration to Highcharts.

2. Highcharts depends on the DOM existing to render.


## Getting started

1. Add the module to your React app:

`npm install react-highcharts-wrapper`


2. Follow the instructions how to use it (coming soon).
